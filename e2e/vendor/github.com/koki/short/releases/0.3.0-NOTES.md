This version adds shorthand syntax for:

* Endpoints
* Ingress
* CSI Persistent Volume

We've improved the modules system:

* Templates support path-based indexing, e.g. ${foo.things.2.x}
* Removed cumbersome `exports` syntax. Just write your manifest the way you normally would. (Add `imports` and `params` as needed.)

We're better than ever at helping users get their files right:

* Error messages come with the path where they originated: `$.pod.containers.0.env.2`
* Catch typos in your YAML field names. No more letting `kubectl` silently drop mistyped fields.
