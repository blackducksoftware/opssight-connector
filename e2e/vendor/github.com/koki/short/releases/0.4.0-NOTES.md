This version adds shorthand syntax for:

* ControllerRevision
* CustomResourceDefinition
* Event
* InitializerConfiguration
* PodDisruptionBudget
* PriorityClass
* PodPresets
* PodSecurityPolicy
* ApiService
* Binding
* Namespace
* LimitRange
* ClusterRole

Documentation for these types is coming soon.

Fixed bugs:

* Pod Probe Ports weren't being set properly.
* Serialization code wasn't using the koki/json library, so empty fields were still not omitted.
