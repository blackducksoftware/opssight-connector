# Guidelines for using Short

**We encourage users to read, write and maintain all of their Kubernetes resources using Short.**

We believe this approach will maximize the benefits of Short the most. 

# Steps to create short spec files
We recommend the following steps for creating Short spec files

- Start with an [Example](../resources/index.md#resources) or [YAML Skeleton](../resources/index.md#resources) for the resource 
- Fill in the fields that you need
- Remove the keys for fields that are unnecessary
