## Overview

The opssight-connector provides integration between Black Duck Hub and OpenShift v3 or Kubernetes. In the current implementation, pre-existing images and pods are automatically discovered and monitored. When a new image or pod is discovered, the integration kicks off a scan engine container to perform the scan and upload the results to your Black Duck Hub instance.
